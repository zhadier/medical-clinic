# Medical Clinic

> Build a relational database for a Medical clinic using `PostgrSQL`. It is a complete database with data about: patients, medical_histories' treatments, and invoices.

## Getting Started

```bash
> git clone git@github.com:zhadier/medical-clinic.git
> cd medcal-clinic
```

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
